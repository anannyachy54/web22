 <p>From cutting down on stress, to lowering your chances of developing a heart disease, the health benefits of traveling are huge. You may stay sitting on a chair all day long at the workplace: including some walking to your trip is sure to make your body feel better. For some people, wandering abroad is even a cure for depression and anxiety. Of course, it's not a foolproof cure, but it might help you feel better, both physically and psychologically.

    Traveling more is likely to have a tremendous impact on your mental well-being, especially if you're no used to going out of your comfort zone. Trust me: travel more and your doctor will be happy. Be sure to get in touch with your physician, they might recommend some medication to accompany you in your travels, especially if you're heading to regions of the globe with potentially dangerous diseases.</p>

    <p>I have no doubt that you're quite the conversationalist. That being said, including a few stories from abroad is likely to grant you even more attention. Mentioning something that most people aren't familiar with or bring a new perspective is always a good way to shine in a social situation. No need to write a whole travel essay, just discuss what you've seen and where you've been: people who are accustomed to their daily life will travel with your words.

        During my trip to Egypt, my Airbnb host and I went out for dinner. He had been to some many different places, the conversation lasted all night long, and I wasn't bored for one minute.

        Who do you think people want to listen to: the guy who spent his vacations at home doing some gardening and reading the newspaper, or the one who spent a week in Cuba, driving an old American car, swimming with dolphins and tasting deliciously spicy food?

    <p><br>  MAURITIUS<br><br>Mauritius is a small country with a big heart. Located off the south-eastern coast of Africa, this island nation is a magnet for enthusiastic lovers and seekers of a tropical haven. Mauritius is no stranger to luxury resorts. Indulge yourself with some of the finest things and amenities money can buy as you gaze into the vastness of the Indian Ocean. Outside the resorts, get your adrenaline running by choosing from a host of activities and sports. The bright and sublime waters encircling the island make for perfect conditions for some snorkelling or diving. If getting wet isn't your thing then relax with some quiet games of golf or horse-riding sessions. Make sure to try the local cuisine as well. Influenced by the French, Indians, Chinese and Creole communities, Mauritian food is a true representation of the many years of trade and cultural influx from other parts of the world.</p>
